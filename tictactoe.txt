Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses , or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies” , is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players

Combinatorics
When considering only the state of the board, and after taking into account board symmetries (rotations and reflections), there are only 138 terminal board positions. 
A combinatorics study of the game shows that when "X" makes the first move every time, the game outcomes are as follows

91 distinct positions are won by (X)
44 distinct positions are won by (O)
3 distinct positions are drawn (often called a "cat's game")
